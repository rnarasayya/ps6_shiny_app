This dataset is a monthly count of Seattle Public Library checkouts by title for physical and electronic items. The dataset begins with checkouts that occurred in April 2005 and includes data as recent as 2023.
The first panel contains a brief explanation of the dataset and displays the first few rows.
The second panel plots the three most popular types of media checked out over time. It includes two widgets. The first lets the user select whether or not they want to see a connecting line on the scatterplot. The second lets the user choose which types of media can be displayed.
The third panel displays a table of the total number of checkouts where the widget allows the user to choose if they want to see total checkouts grouped my month or by year.
